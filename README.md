This is the source code of the SR-MCC algorithm associated with our CSSP paper:

Xiong, W., Schindelhauer, C., So, H.C. et al. Maximum Correntropy Criterion for Robust TOA-Based Localization in NLOS Environments. 
Circuits Syst Signal Process 40, 6325â€“6339 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00034-021-01800-y

You could use the code for your comparisons at will, as long as the paper above is included as a reference in your manuscript.

---Corrigendum for the paper---

"CIM" in the paragraph next to Fig. 3 should be "correntropy measure".
