This is the source code of the SR-MCC algorithm associated with our CSSP paper:

Xiong, W., Schindelhauer, C., So, H.C. et al. Maximum Correntropy Criterion for Robust TOA-Based Localization in NLOS Environments. 
Circuits Syst Signal Process 40, 6325â€“6339 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00034-021-01800-y

Also, big special thanks to Dr. Slavisa Tomic, as we borrowed some idea from his code for the following work to devise the bisection step in our algorithm: 

S. Tomic, M. Beko, R. Dinis and P. Montezuma, "A Robust Bisection-Based Estimator for TOA-Based Target Localization in NLOS Environments," in IEEE Communications Letters, vol. 21, no. 11, pp. 2488-2491, Nov. 2017, doi: 10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2737985.

You could use the code for your comparisons at will, as long as the two papers above are included as references in your manuscript.

---Corrigendum for the paper---

"CIM" in the paragraph next to Fig. 3 should be "correntropy measure".
